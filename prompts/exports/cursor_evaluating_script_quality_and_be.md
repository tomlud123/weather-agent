which of the 3 generated scripts is the best in terms of readability, robustness, and adherence to modern best practices?

I'll scan the three generated scripts to compare structure, typing, error handling, and API usage.

I reviewed all three scripts and compared structure, typing, error handling, and CLI ergonomics.

- Best overall: gpt5thinking.py
  - Readability: clear function boundaries (`fetch_current_weather`, `main`), argparse-based CLI, consistent stderr messages.
  - Robustness: explicit connect/read timeouts, `raise_for_status` handling with decoded error details, safe JSON parsing with validation and type coercion, returns exit codes instead of exiting inside helpers.
  - Modern practices: `from __future__ import annotations`, precise typing (`Optional[Tuple[str, float, float]]`), avoids side effects in library function.

- Runner-up: gemini25pro.py
  - Decent structure and typing (PEP 604 unions), but no argparse, mixes concerns in `__main__`, and less granular network error handling.

- Weakest: perplexity_free.py
  - Puts `sys.exit` inside the helper function, less flexible; narrower error handling; simpler CLI; still hardcodes API key.

Small improvement to apply to gpt5thinking.py: switch back to reading the API key from the environment (the env-based line is already present and commented) and remove the hardcoded key.
